# Web-Design-Challenge
Web design project based on a previous class project (https://github.com/zarzarbinks0702/Global-Weather-Analysis). 05/22/2021.
Uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A website was built from the ground up to present the results of a previous project (linked above).
Pages exist for a summary, the four categories of plots, comparing the four categories of polts, and the data used to generate the plots.
On the four category pages, analysis is given for all three plots - the original, the northern hemisphere linear regression, and the southern hemisphere linear regression.
The webpages are responsive in design.
